Hi! I am a researcher and data scientist at <a href="http://wic.cl/" target="_blank">Web Intelligence Centre</a> of the Industrial Engineering Department of the Universidad de Chile. I studied Engineering in Information Systems and Management Control at the Economy and Business Faculty (FEN), Universidad de Chile. After I graduated, I got a Software Engineering Diploma at the Department of Computer Science, Universidad de Chile.

I am passionated about research. My favorite research topic is data analytics. I started working with bibliometric data. Understanding the effect that different bibliometric measures had, make me realize the eff

I am currently working in <a href="https://www.akoriproject.cl/" target="_blank">Akori's Project</a>. Akori's Project uses biometric data for predicting clicks in a web site. I am currently working at the segmentation between web users, by using eye-tracker data.

In parallel to Akori's Project, I am also working in a bibliometric tool for reviewing journals impact.

Also, I have worked in other research projects. I started with Bibliometric research, by reviewing journals and articles impact in the areas of Computer Science, Education, and Engineering. In addition, I have worked in two health data projects. One of those projects uses Electronic Health Data for predicting death of an elderly Latin-American population. The other one uses oximetry data for predicting cardiovascular diseases in a sleep-disorder population.

My first step into research was through teaching. I have taught courses related to Information Systems at FEN, and to Web Intelligence in the Engineering Faculty. More details of my teaching journey can be found <a href="https://vlobos-ossandon.github.io/teaching/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Although I love researching and teaching, I have other interests. I am all about the make-up world: I truly believe that make-up is another way of art. I also like oleo-painting. I painted since I was 8 years-old. I also enjoy doing yoga: it keeps my mind in pace and it is also a great excersise! Finally, a few months ago I started pole-dancing lessons. Pole-dancing is a fun challenge! (but sometimes it hurts a lot!!)
