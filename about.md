Hi! I am a researcher and data scientist at <a href="http://wic.cl/" target="_blank">Web Intelligence Centre</a> of the Engineering Faculty, Universidad de Chile. I studied Engineering in Information Systems and Management Research at the Economy and Business Faculty (FEN), Universidad de Chile and then I got a Software Engineering Diploma at the Department of Computer Science, Universidad de Chile.

I am currently working in <a href="https://www.akoriproject.cl/" target="_blank">Akori's Project</a>. Akori's Project uses biometric data for predicting clicks in a web site. I am currently working at the segmentation between web users, by using eye-tracker data. In parallel, I also work in developing a bibliometric tool for reviewing journals impact.

I have also worked in other projects. I started with Bibliometric research, by reviewing journals and articles impact in the areas of Computer Science, Education, and Engineering. I also worked in two health data projects. One of those projects uses Electronic Health Data for predicting death of elderly people. The other one uses oximetry data for predicting cardiovascular diseases in a sleep-disorder population.

My first step into research was through teaching. I have taught courses related to Information Systems at FEN and to Web Intelligence in the Engineering Faculty. More details of my teaching journey can be found <a href="https://vlobos-ossandon.github.io/teaching/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Although I love researching and teaching, I have other interests. I am all about the make-up world: I truly believe that make-up is another way of art. I also like oleo-painting. I painted since I was 8 years-old. I also enjoy doing yoga: it keeps my mind in pace and it is also a great excersise! Finally, a few months ago I started pole-dancing lessons. Pole-dancing is a fun challenge! (but sometimes it hurts a lot!!)
