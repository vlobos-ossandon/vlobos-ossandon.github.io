<p align="justify">In Spring 2014, while I was studying, I have the opportunity of working as a research teacher assistant with professors <a href="https://scholar.google.cl/citations?user=rprb9KwAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao" target="_blank">José M. Merigó</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.cl/citations?user=Ug4b1XQAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao" target="_blank">Gustavo Zurita</a> in Bibliometric research area. This was my first approach to research since I learned the steps for creating an investigation and writing a research article. I also learned that working with data and interpreting it was the research direction that I wanted to follow.</p>

<p align="justify">In Autumn 2016, I wanted to go deeper in my research interests, so I went to work to <a href="http://www.ceine.cl/en/" target="_blank">Business Intelligence Center</a> (CEINE), with professor <a href="https://scholar.google.cl/citations?user=rprb9KwAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao" target="_blank">Sebastián A. Ríos</a>. I learned new techniques for extracting data, like creating Web Intelligence applications, and for analyzing data, such as Text Mining. It was also my first approach into machine learning topics. However, the most important thing that I learned here was Python programming language. I always thought that Excel and .vba was enough for making data visualizations... I was so wrong!! Python really changed my life in a better way ;)</p>

<p align="justify">In Autumn 2017, I went to work to the <a href="http://wic.cl/" target="_blank"> Web Intelligence Centre</a>. There, I went deeper into the research of machine learning applications. Here I expand my data mining knowledge by working with health data.</p>

			<b>A Real-Time Risk of Death Predictive Model in an Elderly Latin American Population</b>. B. Harnecker, V. Lobos-Ossandón, E. Tobar, J. D. Velásquez.
			<p align="justify"> <font size="2">
			<em>"As the population is getting older and life expectancy is increasing, the Hospitals’ Intensive Care Unit (ICU) faces a new challenge: more than half of ICU patients are 65 years older. In Chile, the use of Electronic Health Records in the last years has increased, although not all the patient data is available in electronic format. Both issues are our motivation for identifying death risk factors in old age. By extracting patterns from different data sources, we aim to develop a model for predicting the elderly patient intrahospital risk of death. This work applies the Knowledge Discovery in Databases process for selecting, transforming, and modeling data from the available Electronic Clinical Records, diagnosis, medical procedures, pharmacy and laboratory for the first 24, 48 and 72 hospitalizations hours for each patient. The results show that our model is accurate for predicting intrahospital death for elderly patients. Despite lacking data used for other death risk models, we still develop a real-time death risk model that is a helpful decision tool, and that combines medical expertise with engineering algorithms."</em>

			<b>Predicting Cardiovascular Risk: A Combination of Nocturnal Oximetry and Framingham Index Variables</b>. M. Hernández, V. Lobos-Ossandón, I. Díaz, R. Ruiz, J. Carrillo, J. D. Velásquez.
			</p>
			<p align="justify"> <font size="2">
			<em>"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the main cause of deaths worldwide. However, they can be prevented if they are detected on time. Framingham index is one of the most popular and traditional measures for identifying risk factors of CVDs, but it is not very accurately for all populations. So, this paper proposes a model for early detection of CVDs, which is a novel approach for Framingham index and traditional measures, since it considers oximetry data from patients with sleep disorders. This study uses the data of 5.804 patients, which includes their nocturnal oximetry and a 10-year follow-up medical history of cardiovascular diseases. For each patient, three indicators have been calculated from their nocturnal oxime-try, which have a direct relation with CVDs. Those indicators are combined with the ones from the Framingham Index to develop a prediction model, which estimates the occurrence of a cardiovascular event in the following 10 years. Results show that oximetry variables improve the performance of the Framingham model. Although the predictive power of the sleep disorders variables by itself is not high, the incorporation of those variables to the Framingham model increases its performance. That way, our model is a good alternative for predicting cardiovascular events in patients with sleep disorders, since it is more accurate than the Framingham index for patients with sleep disorders."</em>

			<em>"Computer Science arises as one of the most influential sciences of the last decades. Its influence reflects in many areas and in different ways. This research area is in a constant development, becoming more and more specialized. Traditional views of Computer Science are not enough to describe the topics that are now developing. Thus, this leaves us to question us what are the hot topics in Computer Science today. This work analyzes the most cited papers of Computer Science over the last 25 years (1990-2014), according to Web of Science (WoS) database. WoS categorizes Computer Science into seven categories: Artificial Intelligence, Cybernetics, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Interdisciplinary Applications, Software Engineering and Theory and Methods. Are they enough to describe the most popular subjects in Computer Science? Results show us that there are many topics that are not fully represented by the categories mentioned above and the need for making a distinction between topics. Hot topics in Computer Science today includes Machine Learning, Social Networking and Biochemistry and Technology. How do we categorize these topics in the traditional ones? This paper aims to respond to the questions mentioned above and to propose new categories for Computer Science journals."</em>

			<p align="justify"> <font size="2">
			<em>"Computer Science degrees are very popular currently among institutions worldwide. The proliferation of these programs in different universities has led to the creation of rankings for classifying programs according to their prestige and quality. However, these rankings do not specify the quality of research. This study develops a bibliometric overview of all the journals that are currently indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) database in any of the seven categories connected to Computer Science research. These categories include Artificial Intelligence, Cybernetics, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Interdisciplinary Applications, Software Engineering and Theory and Methods. This study aims to identify the leading institutions over the last 25 years (1991–2015) in each area selected according to a wide range of bibliometric indicators. The results indicate that American universities are the most influential in Computer Science research. However, companies and research centers from different countries also have a strong investigatory presence. This study concludes that Computer Science traverses many institutions."</em>

			<p align="justify"> <font size="2">
			<em>"Bibliometrics is a research field of library and information sciences that aims to study the bibliographic material quantitatively. The aim of this study is to analyse the most cited articles in educational research between 1989 and 2013. For doing so, the study uses the Web of Science database which is usually regarded as the most influential one. The analysis divides educational research in seven general categories in order to make direct comparisons between the highly cited articles. Moreover, an additional list with the two hundred most cited articles in educational research published before 1989 is also included in order to see the influence of old studies compared to the new ones. The results of the study give a general overview of the most cited articles of all time in educational research with a special focus on the last twenty-five years. Most of the leading studies are published in the major journals. However, the interdisciplinary journals and categories tend to obtain more citations due to their interdisciplinary nature that involves more researchers and journals."</em>

			<p align="justify"> <font size="2">
			<em>"IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies (IEEE-TLT) is a leading journal in Computer Science and Educational Research fields that published its first issue in 2008, celebrating in 2018 the 10th anniversary. Inspired by this event, this work shows us a lifetimes general overview of the journal by using bibliometric indicators. The main objective is to grant a complete overview of the main components which affect the journal. This analysis includes key factors such as the most cited documents, the leading authors, institutions and countries of the journal, plus an insight of the publication and citation structure. For doing this, the paper uses the Web of Science Core Collection database to analyse the bibliometric data. Additionally, the paper also uses the VOS viewer software to map graphically the bibliographic material. The graphical analysis uses bibliographic coupling, co-citation and co-occurrence of author keywords. By using this analysis we get a deeper understanding of how IEEE-TLT is linked to other journals and researchers across the globe. Results indicate that IEEE-TLT is an important journal in the areas of Computer Science and Education which is taken into account by a wide range of authors, institutions and countries from all over the World."</em>
